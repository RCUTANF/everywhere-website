Thank you for choosing Sylinko Inc. ("Company", "we", "us", or "our"). We strive to ensure our users have the best experience with our software products, including Everywhere and other services managed via Sylinko Passport.

## 1. Subscription Cancellation
You may cancel your subscription at any time. To cancel, please follow these steps:

Log in to your account at [Sylinko Passport](https://passport.sylinko.com).

Navigate to the "Everywhere" section.

Click "Manage Subscription" and then redirect to the Stripe Customer Portal.

Then select "Cancel Subscription" and follow the prompts to complete the cancellation process.

Upon cancellation, you will continue to have access to the premium features until the end of your current billing cycle. No further charges will be applied after the current cycle ends.

## 2. Refund Policy
We strive to maintain a fair balance between providing value to our users and preventing service abuse. Our refund eligibility is based on the following criteria:

### 2.1 Full Refund Eligibility (Unused Quota)
If you have not consumed any credits or used any service quota within the current billing cycle, you are eligible for a full refund within 30 days of the transaction date.

### 2.2 Conditional Refunds (Used Quota)
If you have already started using your credits or quota, refunds are not guaranteed and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Circumstances we consider include:

- Software Failure during Testing: If you encounter a verified technical defect while testing the software within a reasonable usage threshold, and our team cannot resolve it.

- Service Unavailability: Significant and prolonged downtime that prevents you from accessing our core services.

### 2.3 Billing Errors
We will provide a full and immediate refund for:

- Duplicate Payments: Multiple charges for the same subscription due to a glitch in the payment process.

- Incorrect Charges: Any amount charged in error that does not match our listed pricing.

### 2.4 Connectivity and Network Restrictions
You are responsible for ensuring that your network environment allows access to our Services and any integrated third-party providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic). 

We **do not** grant refunds for the inability to access the Services due to:
- Local network restrictions, firewalls, or proxy/VPN configurations.
- Internet Service Provider (ISP) issues.
- Government censorship or regional blocks.

These situations are outside of our control and do not constitute grounds for a refund, as the digital service remains operational on our end.

### 2.5 No Refund for Violations
If your account is suspended or terminated due to a violation of our Terms of Service (e.g., abusing the API, reverse engineering, or engaging in prohibited activities as outlined in Section 8 of the TOS), you will forfeit the right to any refund, including for any unused quota or remaining subscription period.

All refund requests must be submitted within 30 days of the transaction date via [support@sylinko.com](mailto:support@sylinko.com).

## 3. Free Trials (If Applicable)
If we offer a free trial, you will not be charged until the trial period expires. You must cancel before the end of the trial period to avoid being charged for the subsequent billing cycle.

## 4. Chargebacks and Disputes
We encourage users to contact our support team directly to resolve any billing issues. We aim to provide a fair and rapid resolution. Initiating a chargeback without contacting us first may result in the suspension of your account to protect against fraud. If you believe your account was suspended in error due to a chargeback dispute (e.g., bank error), you may submit an appeal to [support@sylinko.com](mailto:support@sylinko.com) to request account restoration.
